Welcome to the Shipping App!

This app lets you keep track of different retailers that you ship out everyweek. It gives a good way of saving the information in case you need to find out about one the retailers you sent out.

All you need to do is sign up with an email and password, then you are ready to start using it. It is set up by adding a name, how many boxes are going and a User Id so you know who added it.

Thanks for checking it out! I hope you will find it useful.

Usage To use this app, just clone, run rake db:migrate and then run shotgun. Everything should be set up.
